      <b>Jakob Ingebrigtsen</b> (born 19 September 2000)[4] is a Norwegian
      middle- and long-distance runner, world record holder, and Olympic
      champion. <br /><br />
      Ingebrigtsen is the current world record holder for the indoor 1500
      metres, the 2000 metres, and the two mile distance. Ingebrigtsen is a
      two-time World champion, winning gold medals in the 5000 metres in 2022
      and 2023 and a six-time European champion, winning gold medals in the 1500
      m and 5000 m in 2018, 2022 and 2024. <br />He was also the Gold Medalist
      in the 1500 m at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, setting an Olympic and European
      record in the championship final. In addition to the 1500 m, Ingebrigtsen
      holds European records in the mile and 5000 m, and is one of only three
      men (with Daniel Komen and Mohamed Katir) to run a sub-3:30 1500 m,
      sub-7:30 3000 m and a sub-12:50 5000 m.
      <br />
      <br />
      At age 16, Ingebrigtsen became the youngest man in history to run a sub-
      four minute mile, and broke the European Under-20 record in the 3000
      metres steeplechase. <br />As a junior, Ingebrigtsen won four consecutive
      gold medals at the European Cross Country Championships and won a gold
      medal in the 5000 m at the 2017 European <br />U20 Championships. His
      older brothers Henrik and Filip are also middle-distance runners who
      compete internationally. They were trained by their father Gjert
      Ingebrigtsen until 2022.[5]

    <p>On 27 May, still 16 years old, Ingebrigtsen became the youngest athlete in history to run the one-mile distance in less than 4 minutes, when he finished in 11th place in a Diamond League race at the Hayward Field in Eugene, US.[6] On 15 June, he ran almost two seconds faster, when he won the race with a time of 3:56.29 at the Bislett Games in Oslo, Norway.[7]

        On 8 July, in his first attempt at the distance, he beat the European Under-20 record in the 3000 metres steeplechase at the Guldensporenmeeting in Kortrijk, Belgium with a time of 8:26.81.[8]
        
        2018: European 1500 m and 5000 m champion at age 17
        On 26 May, at age 17, Ingebrigtsen ran a 3:52.28 mile in the Prefontaine Classic's Bowerman Mile for fourth place. It is the fastest mile run by a 17-year-old.[9]
        
        2019

        On 20 July at the London Diamond League, he set a new national record and U20 European Record at the 5000 m with 13:02.03, finishing second.
        
        As of 6 October 2019 Jakob was ranked as the second best 1500 m runner in the world, only behind Timothy Cheruiyot.
        
        Making his debut at the distance, he broke Sondre Nordstad Moenâ€™s Norwegian 10 km record at the Hytteplanmila in Hole, Norway on 19 October, with victory in 27:54.
